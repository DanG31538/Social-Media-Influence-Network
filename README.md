## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze social media influence using data from Instagram influencers.

## Pipeline Stages

### 1. Data Collection and Preparation

- Source: Kaggle Instagram Influencer dataset
- Tasks:
  - Download and load the dataset
  - Perform initial data cleaning and preprocessing
  - Handle missing values and outliers
  - Explore basic statistics and distributions

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualize key metrics (followers, engagement rate, post frequency)
- Analyze correlations between different features
- Identify trends and patterns in influencer categories
- Explore temporal aspects of influence (if data available)

### 3. Feature Engineering

- Create composite influence score
- Derive network features based on influencer similarities
- Generate time-based features (e.g., follower growth rate)
- Develop category-specific metrics

### 4. Model Development

- Implement multiple modeling approaches:
  - Regression for influence score prediction
  - Classification for influencer tier categorization
  - Clustering to identify influencer archetypes
  - Custom graph models for network analysis
- Perform model selection and hyperparameter tuning
- Evaluate models using appropriate metrics

### 5. Results Interpretation

- Analyze feature importance to understand key drivers of influence
- Interpret cluster characteristics to identify influencer types
- Visualize network structures and communities
- Draw insights on factors contributing to content virality

### 6. Deployment (Proof of Concept)

- Develop a simple API to serve model predictions
- Containerize the application using Docker
- Set up basic monitoring and logging

### 7. Future Work

- Incorporate additional data sources (e.g., post content, user interactions)
- Implement more advanced network analysis techniques
- Develop a user interface for interactive exploration of results
